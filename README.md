# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Decisions

Github's API supports `since` query parameter. This is given in the link header returned from the API call and points to the id of the user last seen. User ids are not continuous and must be fetched separately, rather than calculated.
However, not all link header relations are supported for all endpoints. "/users" endpoint didn't seem to support "prev" relations.

This project utilizes server-side pagination as it is more memory efficient.


UI:
Card: If no name is available, it displays the user's username instead. If no email is available, it'll tell you.
creating separate styled components encapsulates styling logic for each part of a component.
styles are scoped to the specific DOM element.
If there are styles that are shared (like font maybe) then use mixins using 'css' from styled components



Future improvements:
- Containerization
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline
- Prefetch and cache information to lessen the number of calls to the frontend

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
